Fantasy Name and Title Twitter Bot (FNTTB)
==========

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). You also need a Twitter App access token, consumer key, and associated secrets: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

(You'll need to add all that info to metaphor.js before running the program, otherwise Twitter won't play nice. Don't worry, it's all commented.)

Add your twitter auth config into config/config.js.template and rename to config/config.js

> npm install

> npm start
